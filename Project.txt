The goal of this project is to deliver a sporting app that would enable coaches to save significant information about matches and debrief objectively using statistics with their players.

A good app to "copy" is "tennis tracker" (look it up - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nabocorp.tennistracker.android.tennistracker&hl=fr).

Design constraints :

1- ergnomic interface (use fragments, menus like toolbars and navigation drawers, ...), adapt the interface to landscape, portrait, french and english

2- locate the matches (latitude, longitude and geocoding - transform these into a street name)

3- take pictures of the match and save them locally

4- save statistics locally for 5 previous matches (in a sqlite database)

5- save full statistics on a real external database

6- be able to display information about any previous match (read the information from the local database or the distant one)

7- UP TO YOU TO DEFINE MORE FUNCTIONS
